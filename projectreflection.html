  <h2>Project Reflection</h2>
  <p>For the past few weeks, we have been working on our Micro Site projects. We also had a peer reveiw of our sites in order to get different perspectives and pinpoint any issues our site may have. For my project, I chose to build a website for Island Beach State Park in New Jersey. You can check it out here: <a href="https://improved-carnival-v664gq46jpwqfpr5r-5510.app.github.dev/microsite/index.html">Island Beach State Park</a> I recieved great feedback from many of my peers and they pointed out things I could improve. In this post, I will reflect on the development experience, the peer reviews, what I did well, and what I could improve. First, I'll reflect on the development process.
  </p>
  <h3>Development Process</h3>
  <p>This project was a great learining expereince for me. I used and built on many skills I already have and learned new skills, such as javascript. While I've worked with Javascript some before, it was pretty limited. For this project, I've had to go deeper and use more Javascript than I had previously. As with any project, there were things I did well and things I could improve. 
  </p>
  <h3>What I Did well</h3>
  <p>There were several things I felt that I did well in this project. I'm very proud of the overall layout and design of the site as well as the functionality.</p>
