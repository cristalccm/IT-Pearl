  <h2>Paddle. Explore. Breathe. Adventure starts here. </h2>
  <br>
      <p class="intro">Nestled in the heart of the Ozark Mountains, just minutes from the Buffalo National River—the first designated national river in the United States—our business offers the perfect launch point for unforgettable outdoor adventures.It's a quiet, breathtaking place wrapped in soaring bluffs, crystal-clear streams, and endless stretches of wild, wooded trails. Whether you're floating down the river, hiking through the woods, or just relaxing in a cabin under the stars, this place is made for people who love the outdoors as much as we do. It's the kind of place that makes you slow down, breathe a little deeper, and really take in the beauty around you.</p>

      <h3 class="story">Our Story</h3>
      <p>We're two lifelong friends who've always shared a deep love for nature and the outdoors. After spending so many years exploring trials, rivers, and wild places, we decided it was time to turn that passion into something real. We then came upon this beautiful peace of land near the Buffalo National River, we knew it was the perfect spot to start somethign special.What started with a couple of cabins and a handful of canoes has grown into a dream come true. Our goal is to give people of all walks of life a place to explore, breathe, paddle,and expierence the same joy that inspired us from the beginning.  </p>
